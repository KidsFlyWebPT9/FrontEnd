Flying with children can be very difficult.  For instance, dealing with luggage, boarding passes, passports, strollers, etc., can be tedious when also tryingo watch and manage young children. Kids App provides users with a network of vetted, qualified assistants to help parents from the m toment they reach the airport to the moment they arrive at their destination. 
Kids App service professionals are alerted to the location, day, and time of a user's arrival to a designated airport.  At that point Kids App service professionals will handle/check-in luggage, secure boarding passes, and escort user's to their gate.  Parents will no longer have to split their attention between their children and the tasks involved with getting to their flight.
